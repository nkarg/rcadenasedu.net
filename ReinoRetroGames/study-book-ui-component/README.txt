 I've always loved art books from games such as Final Fantasy etc. Recently, I stumbled upon a huge collection of these in a Swedish geek shop and something struck me: "I want to create a digital version of these!"

It was a perfect opportunity for me to mix in a little VueJS as well. 

For the curious of you, the base for the books and their 3D rotations are based on Mary Lou's awesome-as-usual "3D Book Showcase" demo from 2013.
