A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/lonekorean/pen/uHxBp.

 Drag and drop an image from your desktop to generate a single element, pure CSS reproduction. Provides a scaling option, preview, and all the CSS to make it happen.

You've probably already guessed that this uses the box-shadow hack. Fun to play with, but not the best idea for your actual sites.

I used this generator to help create my [Chrono Trigger Animated Pixel Art](http://codepen.io/lonekorean/pen/EneyC).
